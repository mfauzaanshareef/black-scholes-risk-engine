# black-scholes-risk-engine
A project to estimate the risk of a portfolio by computing the implied vol, option prices and greeks. Interprets the greeks and optimises the portfolio by applying hedges to keep the portfolio delta neutral. Simulates this daily, draws charts for smiles, term structures, and hedged vs unhedged returns. Validates prices using Monte Carlo.
